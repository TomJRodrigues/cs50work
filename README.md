This is the repo for all of my work done in Harvard's CS50 class.


This class was tough, and it was a brutal introduction to Computer Science,
rather than putzing around with advanced libraries.

Highlights include:
PHP based web-store
hooking into Google Maps API and harnessing AJAX
pointer math
validating image files through header data
reading a "corrupt" image file
home-spun credit card validation
heinous debugging fun using gdb
home-spun caesar ciphers
home-spun vigenere ciphers
optimized dictionary scanning and sorting
