0.  An artificially long word said to mean a lung disease 
    caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust
    
1.  Get's a resource usage. In speller.c it uses ru_utime, which is the total amount of time
    spent executing in user mode.
    
2.  There are 16 members in struct rusage.

3.  It's less resource intensive to pass a pointer rather than the entire 16-member
    struct and all their values.
    
4.  How main reads words from a file:
    
    The for loop operates primarily through fgetc. That iterates through the word, collecting
    each character until it hits an EOF character, like a space or a newline character. 
    If we reach a string of characters that includes a digit or if the string is longer than 45 characters,
    then the string is aborted and the index is reset to 0 and we move onto the next word. Otherwise, fgetc
    reads each character and checks it against the dictionary, we increment variable words and if the word
    is misspelled then we increment misspellings and print it to the user
    
5.  Using fscanf would make it much harder to reject words with numbers in them.
